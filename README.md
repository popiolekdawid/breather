# Breather - a life support machine

This is a project me and my friends were working on during our time at Lublin University of Technology. It has earned us the title of Bachelors of Engineering and was the subject of our thesis.
The device is built with an STM32 microcontroller and the GUI app is ran on a Raspberry Pi.
