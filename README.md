# Breather - a portable life support machine

This is a project me and my friends were working on during our time at Lublin University of Technology. It has earned us the title of Bachelors of Engineering and was the subject of our thesis.\
The aim of the project is to someday save lives in hard to reach places.

Below you can see the prototype we made.
